## Overview

### *DoctorConnectBD: A Digital Platform for Rural-Urban Telemedicine Services and Consultation System in Bangladesh*

Access to quality healthcare is a significant challenge in rural Bangladesh, where the ratio of doctors to patients is extremely low, and specialized doctors are primarily concentrated in urban areas. Rural patients often face tremendous difficulties in traveling to cities, including high costs, lack of guidance, and logistical challenges, which can delay treatment and worsen health outcomes.

*DoctorConnectBD Bangladesh* aims to bridge this gap by providing a **digital telemedicine platform** that connects rural patients with qualified city doctors. Through this system, patients can **search for doctors based on specialization**, **book online appointments**, and **participate in virtual consultations** without the need to travel long distances. The platform also allows doctors to **review patient reports**, **conduct follow-ups**, and manage appointments efficiently.

By leveraging modern web technologies, *DoctorConnectBD Bangladesh* seeks to **enhance accessibility, reduce travel burdens, and ensure timely medical consultation** for rural populations, ultimately improving healthcare delivery across the country. This project demonstrates a practical application of software engineering principles to solve a pressing social challenge, combining usability, scalability, and security in a single system.
